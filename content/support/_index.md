# Kosmorro Support

Getting started with Kosmorro or Kosmorrolib, but lost?

There are multiple ways to get help!

## About version support

Because Kosmorro and Kosmorrolib are two specific projects that don't have the same goal, they don't benefit of the same version support.
See [this page](@/support/versions.md) for more information.
